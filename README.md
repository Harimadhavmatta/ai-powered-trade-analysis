# ai-powered-trade-analysis
This GitHub repository implements an algorithmic trading strategy using machine learning on historical stock price data. The project leverages the Alpha Vantage API for data acquisition, featuring a Python script for fetching intraday stock prices. A RandomForestClassifier is employed to generate trading signals based on price trends, and a backtesting module evaluates the strategy's performance. The plot_results function visualizes closing prices, buy/sell signals, and portfolio values. Additionally, the script predicts future stock prices for the next hour using the trained machine learning model. Users can replace the Alpha Vantage API key, stock symbol, and interval to customize the analysis for different stocks and timeframes. The README provides clear instructions for setup and usage, enabling users to understand, replicate, and extend the algorithmic trading strategy.
